# Changelog

## 0.2.0 - 2026-03-25

Public beta candidate for the `v2` release line.

### Highlights

- recommended default workflow narrowed to permissive-license components
- `RKO-LIO + graph_based_slam` established as the dogfooded default path
- graph backend improved with better adjacent edges, loop dedup, robust kernels,
  multi-candidate validation, and safer state handling
- Autoware-compatible pointcloud-map export hardened with
  `map_projector_info.yaml` and bundle verification
- end-to-end Autoware dogfood flow added:
  `rosbag2 -> SLAM -> map save -> Autoware map loaders -> rviz2`
- benchmark reporting, HTML report generation, and release/readiness gate added
- CI expanded with default workflow checks and release-readiness fixture jobs
- contribution guide, Autoware quickstart, benchmarking guide, and issue
  templates added for external reports
- fixed public Autoware entrypoint added: `scripts/run_autoware_quickstart.sh`
- comparison page and checked-in release notes added for public `v2 beta`
- MID360 current default tuned to `voxel_size=0.5`, `max_range=80.0`,
  `search_submap_num=5`, `loop_edge_dedup_index_window=20`,
  `loop_edge_info_weight=200`

### Notes

- this release is suitable for public beta / developer preview distribution
- the default workflow remains focused on pointcloud-map generation for
  Autoware; lanelet generation is intentionally out of scope
