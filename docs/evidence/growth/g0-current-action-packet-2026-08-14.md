> Exact reviewed product-candidate tip: `3d64ed556aca8a680f09e0f7e8c12a3c8d3e6a6d`

This reviewed tip is the code-bearing product-candidate revision; later
docs-only handoff synchronization and product UX follow-up commits must remain
identified separately.

This is the current, read-only handoff for the G0 release-hygiene decision.
It was first captured on 2026-08-14 and refreshed on 2026-08-15 after the
dashboard UX, CI-registration, version-priority, final PR-head CI,
packet-command-contract, fail-closed usability-worksheet, paired scorecard,
safe observer-packet-output, and safe first-map-dry-run-plan-output follow-ups.
The code-bearing packet tip is required to be an ancestor of the current
checkout revision; later synchronization and product UX follow-up commits
must remain described in this handoff. It replaces
neither the historical 2026-08-11 decision packet nor any maintainer approval.
Its purpose is to prevent an old commit, old version, or one external action
gate from being mistaken for the current state.

## Current evidence

| Check | Current result | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Draft PR #427 | open, draft, mergeable; its current head includes packet synchronization and product UX follow-ups after the reviewed tip above | source candidate is publicly reviewable |
| PR-head CI | **PASS** for the current branch tip (9 / 9 checks) | revalidation covers the version-priority UX and packet synchronization; CI is not a release approval |
| Publication slice plan | `PLAN_VALID_LOCAL_ONLY`; 228 paths / 7 slices, clean at the refreshed tip | local inventory is complete and cannot authorize a GitHub write |
| v0.9.1 release audit | **NOT_PUBLISHED** | no `v0.9.1` tag or GitHub Release was found |
| v0.9.1 GHCR images | **ABSENT** for `v0.9.1-humble` and `v0.9.1-jazzy` | no immutable candidate image identity exists |
| Onboarding matrix | 4 / 4 product PASS; 0 / 4 comparable; **BLOCKED** | Docker is v0.9.0, source is v0.9.1, and human measurements are missing |
| v1 readiness | **8 / 10** | distribution and independent adoption remain incomplete |
| Accepted independent maps | **0 / 3** | cohort remains closed |

The exact public checks are intentionally re-runnable:

```bash
gh pr checks 427 --repo rsasaki0109/lidar_slam_ros2
python3 scripts/check_publication_slice_plan.py --json
python3 scripts/check_published_release.py --version 0.9.1 --json
python3 scripts/check_onboarding_trial_matrix.py --json
python3 scripts/check_v1_readiness.py --json
python3 scripts/first_map_validator_cohort.py --json
python3 scripts/check_g0_readiness.py \
  --include-published-release \
  --published-release-version 0.9.1
```

These commands perform read-only inspection. The last command must remain
`WAITING_FOR_PUBLIC_GATES` while the matrix is not comparable; `--render` must
not be used as a reason to recruit.

## Separated action gates

| Gate | Current state | Authorized scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L0 local preparation | complete for this packet | code, tests, docs, offline audits, and read-only inspection |
| E1 source review | public Draft PR / CI PASS | review this exact tip; no merge is implied |
| E2 artifact hosting | **NOT_AUTHORIZED / NOT_PUBLISHED** | fixture host or immutable evidence record only after a separate host, license, checksum, and retention decision |
| E3 community mutation | **NOT_AUTHORIZED** | no issue labels, comments, closures, starter issues, Discussions, or recruitment |
| E4 stable release | **HOLD / NOT_AUTHORIZED** | no tag, GitHub Release, package, image promotion, or announcement |

Approval of one row never approves another. In particular, green CI does not
authorize E2, E3, or E4, and a published identity would not by itself create a
comparable human trial.

## Safe transition order

1. Review the code-bearing candidate tip and this refreshed packet; confirm
   the current PR-head CI remains green, then stop if the branch, PR, or local
   inventory drifts. Do not measure mixed-version rows.
2. If E2 is separately chosen, publish one explicitly selected immutable
   fixture/evidence host and perform a remote re-download and checksum audit.
3. If E4 is separately chosen later, follow `RELEASING.md`; after publication,
   require `check_published_release.py --require-published` and record both
   image digests before using them in a trial.
4. Generate a new observer packet from the exact public source commit and both
   published image digests. Use
   `scripts/prepare_onboarding_matrix_packet.py`; do not reuse the current
   v0.9.0/v0.9.1 mixed matrix.
5. Run fresh dedicated Humble/Jazzy Docker and source trials with a human
   observer. Record active operator time, command count, workflow download,
   peak disk, wall time, and output size; blank measurements remain
   non-comparable.
6. Only after at least one comparable Docker PASS and one comparable source
   PASS may the E3 cohort decision be reconsidered. Three accepted independent
   reports are still required for the v1 gate.

## Current decision

```text
E2 artifact host: DEFER — no host or upload authorized
E3 community mutation: DEFER — cohort and issue operations remain closed
E4 v0.9.1 release/images: DEFER — G0 matrix and distribution gates remain open
```

This packet is evidence and handoff text only. It performs no release, image,
fixture, issue, branch, review, or community mutation.
